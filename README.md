# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we take data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php and use Leaflet to plot circles on the map
with the radius depending on magnitude, and color depending on the depth of the earthquake.

I used code from the bootcamp lessons and https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/ to create the circles and the legend.
